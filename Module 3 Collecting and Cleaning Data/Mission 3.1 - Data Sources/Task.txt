Mission 3.1 - Data Sources
Data comes from multiple sources, and data analysts often gather data from multiple sources and combine these for data analysis. The process of gathering data from these sources and presenting it is called data consolidation. Data consolidation is a crucial step, as the accuracy of the insights from your data analysis depends heavily on the quality of data used.
